= Custom theme for reveal.js

My theme for reveal.js \o/

TODO image

== Usage in an existing reveal.js project

- Copy the `css` and `lib` folders inside a `revealjs` installation folder, and say *yes* when asking to merge the folders. (TODO is there a nice command line to do that?)
- Go in the `revealjs` folder and run: `npm run build -- css-themes`, which will produce `revealjs/css/theme/customtheme.css`
- Now this `revealjs` folder has a new theme called `customtheme` which can be used as any other theme.

== Development and testing

In a dev environment, to test the theme:

- Run `compile.sh` that will:
    - clone reveal.js,
    - create symbolic links, in order to add our custom theme to reveal.js,
    - compile all reveal.js themes (including ours).
- Open `demo.html`, which points to our compiled theme, and admire the result.
