== Installation (or update)

Go into a reveal.js project folder and run:
```
sh -c "$(wget https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/bousse-e/stereopticon/raw/master/install-or-update-stereopticon.sh -O -)"
```

== Requirements

For the theme to work correctly, the following reveal.js options *must* be set:
----
center: false,
display: 'flex',
width: 1920,
height: 1080,
----

The option `margin: 0` is not mandatory but can be used to remove the dark gray frame around slides.

== Compilation

The theme is written in SCSS, and can be compiled into CSS using the setup that already exists for compiling the official reveal.js themes.

*Instructions:*

- Clone this repository.
- Download reveal.js or use an existing reveal.js installation folder.
- Copy the `src/css` and `src/lib` folders of the stereopticon repository inside the reveal.js installation folder, and say *yes* when asking to merge the folders.
- Go in the reveal.js folder and run: `pass:[npm install && npm run build -- css-themes]`, which will produce `reveal.js/css/theme/stereopticon.css`.
- Now this reveal.js folder has a new theme called `stereopticon` which can be used as any other theme.


== Development and testing

To dev and test the theme:

- Run `compile.sh` that will:
    * clone reveal.js,
    * add symbolic links into the cloned reveal.js pointing to the stereopticon files,
    * compile all reveal.js themes (including ours).
- Start a web server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` or `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8080 -b 127.0.0.1` or even better with https://github.com/tapio/live-server  to have live-reload each time files are modified.
- Open `http://localhost:8080/demo` which should show the stereopticon demo.
- Work on stereopticon files and see the results in the demo.
- When happy with the changes, commit!

_Optional: if working in a VSCode environment, use the https://github.com/wk-j/vscode-save-and-run[Save and Run] extension to automatically run `compile.sh` after each SCSS file change. Combined with https://github.com/tapio/live-server[live server] this is amazing._
