== Installation and usage

It is recommended to organise your presentation website as follows:

- Prepare a folder called `stereopticon`.
- Download the latest https://gitlab.univ-nantes.fr/bousse-e/stereopticon/-/tags:[stereopticon release], and extract it into the `stereopticon` folder.
- Download https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases[the proper Reveal.js release] and extract it as a folder `reveal.js` next to the `stereopticon` folder.
- Prepare your slides in a Reveal.js `index.html` file at the root of your website, and make sure to prefix all Reveal.js includes with `reveal.js`, and to include the stereopticon theme as `stereopticon/stereopticon.css`.
As an example, look at our link:demo/index.html[demo source code].

== Requirements

- The supported *Reveal.js* version is 4.5.0 ;
- For the theme to work correctly, the following reveal.js options must be set:
+
----
center: false,
display: 'flex',
width: 1920,
height: 1080,
----
- The option `margin: 0` is not mandatory but can be used to remove the dark gray frame around slides ;
- If *asciidoctor-revealjs* is used, the supported version is 5.1.0.

== Compilation

The theme is written in SCSS, and can be compiled into CSS using the setup that already exists for compiling the official Reveal.js themes.

*Instructions:*

- Clone this repository.
- Download https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/releases[the proper Reveal.js release] and extract it as `reveal.js`.
- Copy the `src/css` folder of the stereopticon repository inside `reveal.js`, and say *yes* when asking to merge the folders.
- Go in the reveal.js folder and run: `pass:[npm install && npm run build -- css-themes]`, which will produce `reveal.js/css/theme/stereopticon.css`.
- Now this reveal.js folder has a new theme called `stereopticon` which can be used as any other theme.


// == Development and testing

// To dev and test the theme:

// - Run `compile.sh` that will:
//     * clone reveal.js,
//     * add symbolic links into the cloned reveal.js pointing to the stereopticon files,
//     * compile all reveal.js themes (including ours).
// - Start a web server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` or `ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8080 -b 127.0.0.1` or even better with https://github.com/tapio/live-server  to have live-reload each time files are modified.
// - Open `http://localhost:8080/demo` which should show the stereopticon demo.
// - Work on stereopticon files and see the results in the demo.
// - When happy with the changes, commit!

// _Optional: if working in a VSCode environment, use the https://github.com/wk-j/vscode-save-and-run[Save and Run] extension to automatically run `compile.sh` after each SCSS file change. Combined with https://github.com/tapio/live-server[live server] this is amazing._
